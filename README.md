# CS-360

          The goal of this app was to allow users to keep track of events and also provide reminders when wanted. In order to provide this for the user the app needed to be able to store login credentials and event information in a database that used a seperate table for each. The user needed to be able to register if they weren't already, there needed to be a screen that utilized a grid to show the event information, and the user needed to be able to add, update, and delete events and their information. With that said, there needed to be a login, register, home, add event, and calendar (or grid) screen so that the user would get the full benefit of the application goals.
         Testing is a necessary part of any type of development and using the emulator in Android Studio helped me a lot since I got to see how my layout files looked and how the background code operated all in one which showed even the minor issues that could easily go unnoticed. The testing also showed me ways that I could imporve upon what I already had. For example, the home screen for the app was very bland but adding the grid to the home screen made it busy while making the calendar screen irrelevant so instead I created a custom list view that was meant to display only up to six upcoming events. That being said, I performed best when creating the UI for the app.
